# Computing With Words (CWW) Framework
 A prototype implementation that learns the word meanings from the user, represents them using fuzzy sets and adapts the meanings over time to the evolving experiences of the user.
The framework was wrapped with a graphical user interface to facilitate real-world experiments for a recipe recommendation application.
